Long ago B.C. (before Corona), our team met whilst doing our Masters at Newcastle University. Since that faithful year, we have forged an inter-continental peptide bond that is able to withstand time zone differences and adverse pressure from the upcoming hackaton. Stay tuned :dna:

### Project Description

:ladybug::computer:

Task 1 - Create a negative dataset using different techniques (Permutations, Sequence Reversal, Randomization, Alphabetization);

Task 2 - We chose a simple fully connected network to be used for this classification problem and performed a neural architecture search (NAS) to optimize the model.

All our code can be found on our GitHub page - https://github.com/aidapendas/antibody-pairing

We are working on the `antibody-pairing` challenge.

To predict using our model, press "Open Application" on the left.

### Scoreboard
